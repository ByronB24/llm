Average order value = \u00a345. (70% Website & 30% Amazon Sales.)\nAsking Price: Open To Offers.\nProfit (2024): \u00a3230K.\nReason For Selling: Owner Is Looking To Raise Capital To Purchase His First Home.\nWe are an online retailer of books, courses and training programs to help students maximise their GCSE grades in minimum time.\nThe UK\u2019s market for supplementary learning resources for school subjects, particularly mathematics, has experienced significant growth over recent years.\nFactors such as a lack of individualised attention, limited school resources, and varying teaching methodologies have contributed to this growth. Not to mention the rise in parents home educating their children.\nOur business performance has reflected this in the last 2 years, whereby sales revenue has increased by 36% and net profit by 26%.\nStudents are turning to third-party books and resources as an alternative way to achieve good grades.\nOur success is due to various factors aside from the quality material we provide.\nOne of which is the large volume of positive feedback and customer results. These are from children, parents and teachers in the UK.\nTeacher testimonials have had the most impact in terms of generating sales but are difficult to obtain, giving our products a significant edge over other educational suppliers.\nFurthermore, a memory product that we offer is unique, not taught in the regular school curriculum, and has no competition from other companies or publishers.\nWe have also built a significant catalogue of free content on social media platforms like Facebook and Youtube which help drive sales.\nHaving little competition, low inventory and working capital requirements, and an excellent reputation has allowed our business to thrive.\nWe offer five products with an average order value of \u00a345 and a healthy upsell rate of 20%.\nWe sell our products on our own website as well as on Amazon, achieving high profit margins of circa 40%.\nAlthough demand is strong throughout the year, sales peak between September and March.\nOur digital marketing strategy focuses primarily on paid social media campaigns. Facebook, Google, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat ads generate buyers on the front-end.\nWe achieve a minimum of 250% return on ad spend on a daily-basis, which runs closer to 300% or more during peak months.\nThe acquisition opportunity presented here would appeal to someone looking for a lifestyle business or merging with a similar online/offline business.\nOne growth opportunity is to expand market share in the UK by forming partnerships with schools and government bodies, and providing wholesale opportunities.\nAnother prospect lies in offering tutoring services to our existing customers, to add a recurring revenue stream to the operation.\nWe have a weekly email newsletter (priced at \u00a37 - \u00a310 a month) which was recently automated so it can be delivered on a much wider scale.\nExpanding to America (and other European countries) is a viable option. We recently worked with a fulfilment service in the US and sold several thousand books, providing proof of concept in the region.\nThis business would suit someone who has some prior experience or knowledge of running an e-commerce business that involves online paid social media campaigns to ensure a smooth takeover.\nAs part of the transition, the founder is willing to provide support to the new owner for up to 6 months after the sale.\nPlease get in touch for an NDA after which we can provide a copy of the Business Information Memorandum.\nBusiness Operation\nReasons for selling:\nOwner looking to raise capital to purchase first home\nTrading hours:\n24/7 Operation (Online)\nEmployees:\n1\nYears established:\n10\nOther Information\nOwner financing:\nOwner financing is available. Please contact the seller for more information.\nHome based:\nThis business can be run from home.\nRelocatable:\nThis business can be relocated.\nRelated Businesses\nMiscellaneous Service Businesses\nEducational and School Related Businesses\nE-Commerce Businesses\nMarketing Businesses\nAmazon Stores\nMiscellaneous Service Businesses in London\nEducational and School Related Businesses in London\nE-Commerce Businesses in London\nMarketing Businesses in London\nAmazon Stores in London\nBusinesses in London\nContact Seller\nbookmark\nSave\nbookmark\nSaved\nshare\nError\nshare\nShare\nprint\nPrint\nShare this business\nShare\nPost\nShare\nEmail"
