You can expect to enjoy a huge slice of that (yeah, we went there) by joining the Fat Pizza franchise. We’re on course to become the UK’s 4th biggest pizza chain by 2025, with 50-75 stores planned by the end of 2024 alone.\\nWith high demand averaging £18k in weekly sales, the Fat Pizza franchise has a proven business model that demonstrates our profitability for franchisees. Our low opening costs make this a readily accessible opportunity for entrepreneurs, and your profits will start rolling in that much sooner.\\nWHAT DO WE DELIVER?\\nOur aim is to gain Customers For Life, rather than rely on people now and then coming to us through the odd discount. We do this by making sure all parties get the very best from Fat Pizza:\\nTo our customers, we deliver top-quality, fresh pizzas made straight from flour using our unique secret dough recipe, and we offer a simple pricing structure that’s readily adaptable to market changes.\\nTo our franchisees, our recognized brand gets you off the start line and ahead of the competition before you even put your first pizza in the oven. With our centralized call handling and cutting-edge tech that enhances the customer experience through automated ordering, delivery tracking and A.I.-based targeted segmented marketing, you can focus on core operations, streamlining your workflow and maximizing efficiency.\\nWe also appreciate the importance of digital marketing – no cheap junk mail leaflets – utilizing in-house expertise to engage with customers through social media and online platforms. Perhaps best of all, franchisees gain instant access to our founder, who welcomes direct communication from potential franchisees to answer your questions and share his wealth of experience and industry knowledge. Don’t be shy; contact us to discuss your ambitions and aspirations.\\nACHIEVEMENTS\\nPAPA Gold Award, British Takeaway Awards\\nA growing franchise that has a centralized management and marketing model, so you’re free to run core operations\\nThe Fat Pizza founder is Vice-Chairman of the PAPA Management Committee, helping to formulate industry-level opinions and practices\\nWe’ve developed a system that can reply to each customer in real-time with every delivery\\nOur call center now handles all calls, orders, and inquiries, so you and your franchise partners can all apply yourselves to the most critical part of the operation: making and delivering pizza, burgers, and desserts!\\nFLEXIBILITY TO YOUR NEEDS\\nOur pragmatic approach to helping franchisees run their stores and customers getting their food delivered hot and fresh to their doors means we run takeaway-delivery franchises. What has helped us grow even further in the field and at great speed is that if you currently run an existing food business, it can be converted into a Fat Pizza outlet, or you can attach Fat Pizza to locations like restaurants, pubs, etc. The only geographical restriction is that we don’t allow any Fat Pizza store to open within a three-mile radius of our other outlets.\\nSUPPORT & TRAINING\\nOur menu is extensive yet simple to make, meaning you don’t need to be a qualified chef. Within four hours of training in one of our stores, you’ll be able to make everything yourself from scratch! We also run pioneering support videos demonstrating how to make every item on the menu. After just an hour of working with one of our tablets, you can run an entire store shift.\\nTraining lasts up to a week in one of our stores. After that, you will have ongoing support from us through our centralized call center, responding to all messages, reviews and comments on your behalf. It means we usually know about any issues before you do. This means we can solve problems before they impact you and your sales!\\nFRANCHISEE TESTIMONIALS\\n“Sunny has helped us open our store from store location to opening personally. The organized marketing is all digital, and the App is our best source of income. We do not have to do anything but deliver pizza, which our customers say is the best around.”\\n“No phones ring in my shop, this is what I love most about Fat Pizza. We have the best pizza around, and my friends are looking at buying more stores around my area.”\\nA DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FRANCHISEE\\nOpening up your store includes following the electronic opening procedure to ensure all food safety standards are met. Pizza dough is made up and left to proof in pans before prepping for the day’s shift. All orders come through with a beep on the makeline so you won’t have the endless noise of phones ringing all day. Orders are made and dispatched to our own fleet of drivers using an app, so we always know where the driver is to help monitor and improve delivery journeys.\\nIt’s a simple, effective and efficient operation that has been proven to work through our growing success. Now, we can offer you the chance to join our growing Fat Pizza network today. So get in touch and see what your future could hold with us!\\nHOW MUCH IS A FRANCHISE?\\nIn terms of finance, the costs to open a Fat Pizza franchise vary from £12k (to convert an existing takeaway with no need for new equipment) to around £80k maximum for a brand-new unit from scratch. The central factor of running a Fat Pizza store is staff management. You will typically work with shift managers to set the week’s rota, use the POS system to work out delivery times from previous weeks and “review the reviews!” It’s all about running a smooth operation while building on experience.\\nLocations\\nLocations in the UK\\nOxford\\nRequest Free Information\\nWarwick\\nRequest Free Information\\nLeicester\\nRequest Free Information\\nBerkshire\\nRequest Free Information\\nHertfordshire\\nRequest Free Information\\nCambridge\\nRequest Free Information\\nSurrey\\nRequest Free Information\\nLiverpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nKent\\nRequest Free Information\\nEssex\\nRequest Free Information\\nRequest Free Information\\nRelated categories\\nFood\\nFast Food\\nPizza\\nTop Franchises\\nPrint\\nloading', 'cleaned_content': 'The Fat Pizza - Pizza Takeaway Franchise available in Warwick\\n\\nFranchise Fee:\\n£12,000\\n\\nLiquid Capital:\\n£30,000\\n\\nLocation:\\nWarwick\\n\\nThe pizza home delivery market is currently worth £3.7 billion.

The business is positioned on one of the most popular streets in this vibrant market town.\\nGeographical sales spread covers up to a 30 mile radius, including Herts, Buck, Beds, Essex and north London.\\nPresently this business only supplies wood, stone and porcelain, therefore there is the opportunity to monetise installations as currently all secured installation is given out to third party installers due to time constraints on the present management. Typical fitting timetable runs from 4 to 12 weeks ahead subject to time of year and for between 1 and 3 installers.\\nPresent on the high street for 7 years, the business attracts many customers through its high street location. Website enquiries are steady and solid, benefiting by a website highlighting all our other retail units across the south east. High levels of referrals and recommendations also benefit the business.\\nA selective yet wide range of quality flooring and decorative finishes is offered representing many quality brands.\\nSupport and interaction with our other outlets will remain with the opportunity to share website costs to the right purchaser.\\nProperty Information\\nProperty:\\nLeasehold\\nLease Terms:\\n10 years with 5 year opt/review. Current lease expires in June 2026.\\nLeasehold Rent:\\n£26,500                                 per annum\\nLocation:\\nHigh Street location amongst other strong independents in immediate area. Within 100mtrs are high end brand national retailers with a secondary zone.\\nPremises Details:\\nRecently built (9 years) retail and apartment block\\nBusiness Operation\\nExpansion Potential:\\nThe retail floor space of the unit is not fully used for sales, therefore the sales area could be expanded to include a wider range of products. Presently the business is closed on a Monday and most often Friday afternoon due to managers personal commitments. The business would benefit from opening Monday to Friday with full opening hours. The business is open on a Saturday where part time staff take enquiries.\\nThere is much demand in the area for quality vinyls (not sheet) such as Amtico, Karndean etc. A small range of vinyl LVT is sold, however this is an area that would benefit from expansion of choice.\\nLaminate flooring is currently not sold. However quality laminate products from existing suppliers would create a new market presently not accessed.\\nMarketing via estate agents, planning portals, interior designers and 'small project' architects would greatly improve the long term project sales funnel - presently not being carried out.\\nOnline marketing via Instagram, Facebook or Pinterest will greatly expand the marketing footprint resulting in further sales growth.\\nCompetition / Market:\\nPresently no other similar flooring business in the town or area. Nearest equivalent would be around 20 miles away in St Albans.\\nReasons for selling:\\nThe manager/owner is 'getting on'. He has been told it is time to slow down and focus on less and enjoy more sailing. This business is part of a company which is also involved in other activities. The manager/owner intends to spend less day working on the other activity based elsewhere.\\nTrading hours:\\nMonday closed\\nTuesday to Thursday 10:00hrs to 17:00hrs\\nFriday 10:00hrs to 13:00hrs\\nSaturday 10:00hrs to 16:00hrs\\nEmployees:\\n1\\nYears established:\\n7\\nOther Information\\nSupport & training:\\nIt would be expected that a 2 month period of training will be provided across the hand over period.

You don’t need care experience as you don’t do the care work yourself.\\nFranchise Information\\n9/10 people say that if they need care, they’d prefer to receive it in their own home.\\nAn alternative to care homes, Walfinch franchisees address the need to remain independent at home.\\nGrowing Need\\nYou’ll be providing a much-needed alternative. Over 430,000 people live in care homes in the UK. Life expectancy for care home residents between 2021 and 2022 was just 7 years for people aged 65-69. Life expectancy for non-care home residents in the same age group was over 23 years, so your services will reduce the quick deterioration observed in care homes (ONS).\\nNot only that, 9 out of 10 people say that if they need care, they’d prefer to receive it in their own home.\\nYou’ll have access to a growing and under-served market. The number of over 85s in the UK, the group most likely to need home care, was 1.6 million in 2018. By 2048, this is projected to rise to 3.5 million and 5.1 million by 2066 (ONS).\\nYou’ll be in demand. Requests for care were 6% higher in 2021 than in 2015/16 and requests exceeded 2 million for the first time ever in 2022-2023 (The King’s Fund).\\nYour market is far bigger than just the elderly. There were 22.2% more requests for care from the working-age population in 2022 than in 2015/16 and 900,000 additional working-age adults were living with a disability in 2021 than in 2011 (Institute for Government).\\nYou’ll have potential clients from the start. More than half a million people were waiting for adult social care in May 2022 and the proportion of those waiting more than 6 months reached 36.5% in March 2023 which is up from 20.2% in November 2021 (Home Care Association/Institute for Government).\\nYou’ll be in demand all year round so you’ll experience continuous growth, and you’ll have multiple sources of income because you’ll be offering a range of specialist services to lots of different age groups including hourly visiting care and 24/7 live-in care.\\nRegulator Registration Made Easy\\nExperience in care is not necessary if you want to buy a home care franchise. Most franchisees didn’t work in the care sector before joining Walfinch.\\nTracy Lezar, Managing Director of Walfinch Kingston and Weybridge, is South African and worked in various sales and marketing roles before joining Walfinch.\\nTracy and her aunt, Kathleen Plough, were looking at businesses opportunities together when they stumbled across Walfinch.\\nThey very quickly decided to move to the UK to set their franchise up.\\nHowever, with no experience of care and regulations in the UK, Tracy didn’t know where to start when it came to getting her home care business registered with CQC.\\nThis is where Walfinch come in. When you join, you’ll be supported by an experienced Quality and Compliance Manager whose job is to get you registered with your regulator as quickly as possible so you can start trading and focusing on growing your business.\\nTracy is now in the top 5 earners at Walfinch and holds the most live-in care packages in the network.\\nWhat training and support does Walfinch provide franchisees?\\nEven though Sarah has been working in care for a while, most Walfinch franchisees do not come from a care background. This is why your training is extensive and ongoing:\\nInitial Training:\\n5 day face to face programme for 2 directors, followed by 5 days online.\\nSupport registering your business with your regulator\\nHelp recruiting your first Registered Manager\\n8-week compliance training programme, with weekly 1 hour sessions\\nHelp finding your first office\\nBusiness plan and launch strategy\\nSupport setting pay and charge rates\\nOngoing Training:\\nAnnual support calendar including 10-12 online workshops, 3 face to face regional meetings for you, 3 for your Registered Manager, and an annual conference\\nSupport during regulator site visits\\nAssistance buying additional territories\\nGuidance on recruiting the right people\\nRegularly reviewing KPIs to help you hit your targets\\nWeekly marketing surgery\\nAssistance selling your business when you’re ready\\nBecome a multi-unit franchisee\\nOur goals is for you to own more than 1 territory so you can meet your professional, personal, and financial goals.\\nSarah Wickham was one of our first franchisees.\\nSarah completed her NVQ Level 4 in the late 80s because she wanted to become a Registered Manager and she spent 25 years working in this role for some large care companies.\\nSarah is a keen rugby fan and was the President of Southwold Rugby Club between 2017 and 2020.\\nBusiness development is everything at Walfinch and our aim is to help you become a multi-unit franchisee over time.

We will provide a business plan template and this will allow you to adjust key figures to ensure that it is ideally suited to your territory.\\nAre there any other costs I can expect?\\nYes, other costs to budget for include a local office, local advertising, computer, office rent and working capital. Working capital will depend on how much money you need to draw from the business during the set-up of the business.\\nWhat is my expected break-even and how long should it take me to reach it?\\nThe time to reach break-even is governed by how long it takes to find carers and clients for your business but our experience is that it normally takes anything from 12-18 months to achieve profitability.\\nDo I need any healthcare training or background to join Walfinch?\\nNo, but a background in business and an understanding of how a business operates is desirable.\\nWill you help me find clients?\\nYes, we train you to find your first 100 local contacts in your territory and provide training on the business development system. This enables you to find and retain key contacts in your area, who will keep referring clients to you.\\nHow will I know what to charge clients?\\nCompleting a local business plan will clarify the charges which reflect a fair hourly cost for Walfinch services. We help you with a territory review to understand pricing in the territory. This allows you to pay carers well and make a fair profit.\\nIs this opportunity full time or part-time?\\nWalfinch is a full-time management franchise opportunity. Initial franchisee training provides you with the know-how and support to set up and run a care business, as well as giving you an understanding of the care sector.\\nAre locations available?

Not to mention the rise in parents home educating their children.\\nOur business performance has reflected this in the last 2 years, whereby sales revenue has increased by 36% and net profit by 26%.\\nStudents are turning to third-party books and resources as an alternative way to achieve good grades.\\nOur success is due to various factors aside from the quality material we provide.\\nOne of which is the large volume of positive feedback and customer results. These are from children, parents and teachers in the UK.\\nTeacher testimonials have had the most impact in terms of generating sales but are difficult to obtain, giving our products a significant edge over other educational suppliers.\\nFurthermore, a memory product that we offer is unique, not taught in the regular school curriculum, and has no competition from other companies or publishers.\\nWe have also built a significant catalogue of free content on social media platforms like Facebook and Youtube which help drive sales.\\nHaving little competition, low inventory and working capital requirements, and an excellent reputation has allowed our business to thrive.\\nWe offer five products with an average order value of £45 and a healthy upsell rate of 20%.\\nWe sell our products on our own website as well as on Amazon, achieving high profit margins of circa 40%.\\nAlthough demand is strong throughout the year, sales peak between September and March.\\nOur digital marketing strategy focuses primarily on paid social media campaigns. Facebook, Google, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat ads generate buyers on the front-end.\\nWe achieve a minimum of 250% return on ad spend on a daily-basis, which runs closer to 300% or more during peak months.\\nThe acquisition opportunity presented here would appeal to someone looking for a lifestyle business or merging with a similar online/offline business.\\nOne growth opportunity is to expand market share in the UK by forming partnerships with schools and government bodies, and providing wholesale opportunities.\\nAnother prospect lies in offering tutoring services to our existing customers, to add a recurring revenue stream to the operation.\\nWe have a weekly email newsletter (priced at £7 - £10 a month) which was recently automated so it can be delivered on a much wider scale.\\nExpanding to America (and other European countries) is a viable option.

You won’t have to endure ANY of the usual overheads – physical store, licensing fees, stock, staff, etc. – that typically raise your investment and delay profitable returns.\\nWhether you’re a novice or a seasoned entrepreneur, in just six weeks you’ll be selling high-quality, high-value products from reputable brands at £500-£10,000 in RRP. You’ll generate £300+ PER SALE, and the system is designed to require a minimum of five hours per week to fit your work-life schedule.\\nUsing local suppliers – as opposed to importing stock all the way from China – allows you to offer next-day delivery and significantly lower the environmental impact. Despite the vastness of the current e-commerce sector, high ticket dropshipping remains an untapped market opportunity – you’d be surprised how few business owners still don’t utilise this strategy.\\nA TASTE OF OUR SUCCESS\\nOur ‘Copy & Paste’ system – either the Done With You or Done For You approach – has generated profitable revenue of more than £8.25m (margins of 30%). Many of our franchise partners make £50k+ per month in net profit. You’ll have your own Shopify store created by us to fast-track your results and get you off to the best possible start.\\nOur track record has demonstrated our approach works. It’s brought us to this point where we can franchise with business operators like you.\\nWe offer franchisees our bulletproof Action Backed Refund Guarantee should you not generate profits greater than your original investment after twelve months of working with us.\\nOur 50+ 5* Star reviews on Trustpilot speak to our high levels of client satisfaction.\\nTHE MAGIC FORMULA\\nYour role in Dropship Circle™ is to focus on the growth aspects of your business:\\nIdentifying potential customers\\nProposing high-value products and solutions for their needs and challenges\\nEarning substantial upfront income and ongoing passive income with each sale\\nIt couldn’t be simpler! We handle the backend systems, which enable you to scale rapidly with minimal investment in stock or advertising. You’ll gain access to advanced dropshipping techniques and high-ticket product-sourcing methods that we’ve refined through years of experience.\\nDropship Circle does NOT own any of your assets/business nor do we take any commission or equity from your venture (like MLM's do). Everything we provide is owned by you.\\nSUPPORT + TRAINING\\nOur setup is simple, but we want you to realise the absolute maximum potential of your business:\\n30+ hours of training and twice-weekly client calls to keep you connected to the network and backup.\\nExpert guidance directly from Lex, a 7+ figure e-commerce expert, through our intensive masterclass and personalised mentorship.\\nSeven days a week, we support our clients to ensure they succeed.\\nOver £500,000 invested in world-leading expertise, from Shopify agencies to advertising platforms, to ensure our clients get results without the guesswork.\\nComprehensive training led by Lex, a 7+ figure e-commerce expert, covering everything from product selection to advanced marketing strategies. You’ll participate in hands-on workshops and receive personalised mentorship to tailor strategies to your business.\\nWe offer access to a resource library with the latest industry trends and training on our automated systems for efficient operations.\\nIn-house marketing assistance includes guidance on creating effective campaigns.\\nJoin an exclusive community for networking and peer support, ensuring you’re always connected to industry leaders and fellow entrepreneurs.\\nWith Dropship Circle™, you gain the knowledge, tools, and support to achieve outstanding results in high-ticket dropshipping and e-commerce!\\nPROOF OF SUCCESS\\n“The program is exceptionally detailed, and you are supported by a very knowledgeable mentor as well as the backing of a community and a full course. Far superior to anything I have seen online or on YouTube which I looked at originally. I now feel like I wouldn’t have made it far with the alternative options to this one. Today I made my first sale and two months ago I didn’t even have the confidence to start a business.”\\n“Lex is a great mentor, the course has everything from A-B to start a functioning profitable business. If you follow step by step without skipping anything you can start making sales very quickly. Lex is available all the time for support and the community within the Dropship Circle is also very helpful, no regrets with signing up to the masterclass.”\\n“With hard work and support from the Dropship Circle team, it certainly allows you to understand the possible. The hands-on approach Lex takes really makes you feel he cares about your success, this has been pivotal in making this journey enjoyable.”\\nFRANCHISEE REQUIREMENTS\\nTo join Dropship Circle™, we seek motivated individuals passionate about entrepreneurship and eager to succeed in e-commerce. Ideal candidates should have a basic understanding of online business operations, a strong work ethic, and excellent communication skills.\\nWhile prior experience in e-commerce or dropshipping is beneficial, it’s not mandatory, as our comprehensive training programme will equip you with all the necessary knowledge and skills. Financial stability to cover the initial investment and a commitment to our proven system are also essential.\\nA DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DROPSHIP CIRCLE™ FRANCHISEE\\nAs a Dropship Circle™ franchise owner, you decide how much you work ‘in’ your business or use our systems to ‘automate and outsource.’ You begin by reviewing sales and customer feedback from the previous day. You’ll check inventory levels and coordinate with suppliers to ensure timely order fulfilment. Engaging with potential and existing customers through various channels – email, social media, phone calls – is key.\\nThroughout the day, you’ll work on marketing strategies and ad campaigns, optimising your website for SEO and developing content for social media. Attending our weekly group coaching calls and being active in our exclusive community allows you to stay updated on industry trends and receive support from peers and mentors. Regularly analysing your performance and adjusting strategies ensure continuous growth and profitability.\\nYou typically end the day generating between £5-£15k in revenue at a 30% profit margin while spending only 1-2 hours managing the system.\\nVideos\\nDropship Circle Testimonial - James\\nDropship Circle Testimonial - Nic\\nDropship Circle - Training\\nLocations\\nLocations in the UK\\nSt Albans\\nRequest Free Information\\nYork\\nRequest Free Information\\nSolihull\\nRequest Free Information\\nBrixton\\nRequest Free Information\\nBromley\\nRequest Free Information\\nCroydon\\nRequest Free Information\\nChester\\nRequest Free Information\\nWatford\\nRequest Free Information\\nBolton\\nRequest Free Information\\nBlackpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nSunderland\\nRequest Free Information\\nCoventry\\nRequest Free Information\\nStoke-on-Trent\\nRequest Free Information\\nManchester\\nRequest Free Information\\nCardiff\\nRequest Free Information\\nLeeds\\nRequest Free Information\\nEdinburgh\\nRequest Free Information\\nLeicester\\nRequest Free Information\\nGlasgow\\nRequest Free Information\\nBristol\\nRequest Free Information\\nSheffield\\nRequest Free Information\\nNottingham\\nRequest Free Information\\nLiverpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nBirmingham\\nRequest Free Information\\nLondon\\nRequest Free Information\\nRequest Free Information\\nRelated categories\\nBusiness\\nBusiness Services\\nInternet\\nTop Franchises\\nPrint\\nloading\",\n",

However, without specific net profit data, it's difficult to assess the exact ROI. The asking price of £90,000 - £120,000 appears reasonable given the turnover range, as long as net profits align with reasonable expectations based on sales volume. The established infrastructure and growth potential provide additional value for consideration.\",\n",

The problem was my schedule was not the best for anything extra like this. So a friend introduced me to these guys and I gave it a shot. I must say that they’ve done a good job of bringing that extra, ‘stress-free’, sustainable extra income I was looking for. If you have no time on your hands but you really want a high cashflow ecommerce business, then you should consider Trend Hijacking. Thank you.”\\n- Aria P.\\n“Super grateful to Dolapo and the Trend Hijacking team. They delivered on their word with this partnership. I haven’t had to do anything like managing a whole business, marketing or delegating since I’ve been working with them. So it’s been a good experience, and they mean it when they say investor-type freedom or so. If you’re someone trying to build a highly profitable business, but aren’t up for the stress, these team are the to-go-to’s. I have already recommended Trend Hijacking to a few friends and will continue to do so.”\\n- Trisha P.\\nResults like these are the reason why the popular publication Benzinga made a publication about us.\\nWe could only generate results like this because we have systems and procedures in place to make sure success becomes somewhat guaranteed—systems that have generated over $25,000,000.\\nWhy should this matter to you?\\nBecause this opportunity is relatively new and investors and other forward-thinkers have already started partnering with us.\\nInvestors who trust results and systems over fancy gimmicks.\\nThat’s why this opportunity isn’t like any other—it’s new and backed by tried-and-tested systems.\\nThe opportunity we bring to you today is our Trend Hijacking…\\nACQUISITION PARTNERSHIP\\nWhere we help you acquire a business, upgrade it fully for value enhancement(zero work at your end),\\nAnd based on the partnership plan, we help you exit it for a 3-5x EBITDA multiple—and we target upwards of the million-dollar mark with EBITDA.\\nWe command such multiples because we specialize in acquiring and building e-commerce businesses—locating those with high potential but are undervalued,\\nGiving you guaranteed returns right from acquisition, while your acquisition maintains high profitability and endless growth potential.\\nAnd since we handle the entire process for you, freeing you from the daunting task of micromanagement or burnout, we streamline your processes, aiming for a $1,000,000+ EBITDA.\\nWith a 3-5x multiple, you’re looking at up to $5,000,000 at the point of exit.\\nAnd that’s just the beginning…\\nWhen you join many other investors and aspiring entrepreneurs who are jumping on our Acquisition Program, you get:\\n→ A Full Management Team:\\nWe give you our full management team that manages everything from researching a viable e-commerce business to acquiring it, scaling it, and exiting it for 7 to 8 figures all in your name but needless of your effort.\\n→ A 6+ figures per month e-commerce brand with 20% to 30% profit margins:\\nWhen we acquire an e-commerce business in your name, you enjoy profits from it while we scale and build up to an exit.\\n→ 24/7 Support From Our Operations Team - giving you instant feedback + inquiry answers\\n→ High-Ticket-Exit Focus:\\nThe ultimate goal of our partnership is to buy, manage, and scale your business until it is successful enough to be sold for 6,7, or even 8 figures.\\n→ Detailed Business Growth & Exit Plan & Strategy:\\nWe’ll give you a comprehensive business plan showing you how systems are to run at each stage of our partnership and the projected length before exit based on a personalized business strategy and exit plan.\\nAnd if you send in an inquiry right now, you also get a 7-day free trial, where we show you potential acquisition hotspots…\\nAnd map out a plan of action to acquire that business(for below market price), enhance its value(so you enjoy monthly dividend cuts), and eventually exit it for premium numbers.\\nWe’ve already received good feedback from partners currently on this program who started with the 7-day free trial, and here’s what one of them had to say:\\n“I recently had the pleasure of working with the Trend Hijacking team during their 7-day trial period, and I am absolutely blown away by the results.

If you're ready to take on a rewarding and lucrative business, get in touch today for full details!\\nVideo\\nLogin or register to view video\\nProperty Information\\nLocation:\\nThe business operates within the thriving communities of Colchester and Braintree, serving schools, nurseries, and other local organisations with high demand for children's sports activities.\\nPremises Details:\\nThe business is mobile and does not require a fixed premises. Services are delivered directly at client locations, such as schools, nurseries, and holiday camp venues.\\nBusiness Operation\\nExpansion Potential:\\nThe Colchester and Braintree territory offers significant opportunities for expansion, making this franchise an exciting prospect for a motivated business owner. Key areas for growth include:\\nUntapped Schools and Nurseries:\\nThe area is home to numerous schools and nurseries that are not yet serviced. Establishing partnerships with these institutions can dramatically increase the client base and annual turnover.\\nHoliday Camps:\\nThe addition of holiday sports camps provides a lucrative revenue stream and strengthens local brand awareness. With HQ support for marketing and operational planning, the potential for high enrolments is excellent.\\nFree Taster Sessions:\\nDelivering free taster sessions to schools and nurseries is a proven strategy to showcase Super Star Sport’s quality coaching and secure new long-term contracts.\\nCommunity Programmes:\\nExpanding into community-focused sports programmes and events can attract new customers and reinforce the franchise’s presence as a trusted name in local children's activities.\\nLocal Marketing Campaigns:\\nLeveraging targeted local campaigns in combination with national marketing efforts ensures visibility among schools, nurseries, and parents, driving further growth.\\nScaling the Coaching Team:\\nHiring additional staff to meet increased demand will allow the franchisee to offer more sessions and grow revenue without compromising quality.\\nBy utilising Super Star Sport’s award-winning systems, support from HQ, and extensive network resources, a franchisee can confidently expand their operations and maximise the territory’s untapped potential. This business is perfectly positioned for rapid growth in a thriving market.\\nCompetition / Market:\\nThe children’s sports coaching industry has seen steady growth, and while there are competitors in the market, Super Star Sport’s trusted reputation and proven systems consistently set it apart. As the #1 UK nursery sports provider, we have a strong foothold in the sector, supported by a 4.9 Trustpilot rating and an award-winning brand.\\nLocally, smaller independent providers and school-employed PE staff may offer sports coaching services, but they typically lack the comprehensive training, safeguarding standards, and structured systems that Super Star Sport guarantees. Our focus on fun, safety, and positivity, combined with extensive HQ support, ensures our programmes stand out to schools, nurseries, and parents alike.\\nThe Colchester and Braintree area is also growing, providing ample opportunity to establish partnerships with untapped schools and nurseries, outpacing any regional competition. With our national marketing campaigns, industry-leading intranet tools like ZiiK, and the incredible support provided to franchisees, this franchise is well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge and achieve sustainable growth.\\nReasons for selling:\\nAs the franchisor, Super Star Sport HQ is based in Hertfordshire, and the decision to sell the Colchester and Braintree territory stems from the strategic belief that this area would thrive under the leadership of a dedicated franchise director. We recognise that having someone on the ground with full focus, passion, and energy to follow our proven business model will unlock the incredible potential of this region.\\nThis territory has been set up and operated successfully by HQ, even without our full focus, achieving 10 regular clients, £51,000 in annual turnover, and a profitable business model. Imagine what could be achieved with a franchise director fully committed to growing relationships, delivering exceptional services, and expanding the client base!\\nThe area presents huge potential for growth, with untapped schools, nurseries, and community programmes that are ready to benefit from our award-winning children's sports coaching services. With the systems and support we provide, combined with the proven demand in the region, the right person has the opportunity to scale this franchise into an incredibly successful business.\\nThis is a chance for an entrepreneurial individual to take an established and profitable operation to the next level, backed by the full support of the Super Star Sport HQ and our network. We are excited to see this area thrive under the ownership of someone who shares our passion for helping children stay fit, active, and smiling!\\nTrading hours:\\nThe business operates primarily during school hours, aligning with clients’ schedules:\\nMonday to Friday: 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM (school and nursery sessions).\\nSchool Holidays: Hours vary based on holiday camp schedules (typically 8:30 AM – 3:30 PM).\\nSome flexibility is required for client meetings or events outside standard hours, offering an opportunity to maximise engagement and revenue.\\nEmployees:\\n3\\nYears established:\\n12\\nFranchise Information\\nFranchise opportunity:\\nFranchise Resale\\nFranchise terms:\\nThe franchise resale for the Colchester and Braintree territory is offered under the standard Super Star Sport franchise agreement.\\nOther Information\\nSupport & training:\\nComprehensive support and training are provided to ensure the prospective buyer’s success:\\n12-Week Training Programme: Includes a structured induction with modules on coaching, operations, sales, and marketing, culminating in Franchise Certification.\\nDedicated Network Manager: Regular weekly calls during the first two quarters and ongoing support to address challenges and guide growth.\\nLaunch Day: Full marketing and sales support to generate leads and establish the business in the local area.\\nSpecialist Departmental Support: Assistance from experts in HR, training & development, finance, sales, and marketing to ensure operational success.\\nAccess to Intranet Tools (ZiiK): Provides lesson plans, resources, and regular updates to support day-to-day operations.\\nContinuous Professional Development: Regular network-wide training days and collaborative meetings (e.g., LION meetings) to share best practices and drive success.\\nThis level of support ensures a smooth transition and sets the buyer up for immediate and long-term success.\\nFinancing available:\\nYes through third parties\\nHome based:\\nThis business can be run from home.\\nRelated Businesses\\nLeisure Resale Franchises\\nService Resale Franchises\\nChildren's Play Businesses\\nLeisure Resale Franchises in Essex\\nService Resale Franchises in Essex\\nChildren's Play Businesses in Essex\\nBusinesses in Essex\\nContact Broker\\nbookmark\\nSave\\nbookmark\\nSaved\\nshare\\nError\\nshare\\nShare\\nprint\\nPrint\\nListed by\\nSuperstar Sports / SSS Education Group LTD\\nView 1 Superstar Sports / SSS Education Group LTD listings\\nShare this business\\nShare\\nPost\\nShare\\nEmail\",\n",

We’ve also been consecutively placed high in the top 100 franchises in Elite Franchise, reinforcing our reputation as a top franchise choice.\\nPerhaps most impressive of all – and certainly a major factor to help attract new clients – are our established collaborations with industry giants like Disney Performing Arts, Sony and DreamWorks Animation, providing unique opportunities for our schools and students.\\nMany Stagecoach franchisees have celebrated their ten-, twenty- and twenty-five-year business anniversaries with us. One franchisee recently celebrated 30 years of operating their school, showcasing the sustainability of our model.\\nTESTIMONIALS\\n“Stagecoach has done an incredible job of building a great culture with their franchisees. They lead from the top down and I’m very proud to be part of the brand. There’s a reason they’re known as the best in the business and I hope to contribute to that reputation as I move forward with my franchise.”\\n- Kristi Wenaus, Halifax, Canada\\n“A friend who had recently acquired her Stagecoach franchise motivated and inspired me to take the leap and purchase my own. It was a significant and somewhat daunting step, but Stagecoach stood by me throughout the entire process – for which I will forever be grateful.”\\n- Natalie Wright, Stoke Newington, UK\\nWHAT PUTS STAGECOACH CENTRE STAGE?\\nOur core mission is to teach students life skills, fostering qualities like resilience, creativity, and courage that extend beyond the performing arts. All this while having fun!\\nAt Stagecoach Performing Arts, we specialise in providing an exceptional extra-curricular performing arts education for students aged 4 to 18. Our unique approach not only nurtures talent in acting, singing, and dancing but also instils what we call ‘Creative Courage for Life’.\\nOur business model not only thrives within the industry; it makes a positive impact in the communities we serve. You won’t just run a business – you will bring something beautiful, enervating, and cherished by every student who passes through your doors.\\nTHE PERFECT SCRIPT FOR SUPPORT AND TRAINING\\nIt’s understandably daunting to start a business, especially in a new field. That’s why we provide comprehensive support and training to all franchisees, including:\\nMarketing support\\nStudent recruitment assistance\\nGuidance in hiring teachers\\n24/7 access to a Child Protection Officer\\nRegional Franchise Managers are there every step of the way, acting as your tutor, mentor, partner, and confidant\\nOur in-house Education Department ensures teaching at your school is of the highest quality. You won’t be alone in this journey, as you’ll have your very own team of experts to support you.\\nAs a Stagecoach franchisee, you’ll be part of a supportive network, never left to navigate the business world alone. Our Head Office team is there to guide you every step of the way.\\nFRANCHISEE REQUIREMENTS\\nOur franchise model is designed to be accessible to individuals from diverse backgrounds.\\nWhile experience in the performing arts is not mandatory, a passion or affinity for them can be a valuable asset. Neither do you need prior experience in education or business.\\nYOUR ROLE AS A FRANCHISEE\\nA typical day in the life of a Stagecoach franchisee includes working on the various day-to-day needs of your business. For example, you might be following up on customer inquiries, planning marketing activities, chasing fees or reviewing lesson plans with teachers on an average non-school day.\\nMany Stagecoach franchisees work from home and utilise the flexibility of the business opportunity to work around their other commitments, e.g. looking after children.\\nOn days when you have classes running, you’ll need to arrive early at the venue to set up the noticeboard and check classroom spaces are safe, prepped and secure. You’ll greet your teachers and meet the parents and guardians of the students as they are dropped off for class. You will then take a register at the start of the class.\\nWhilst your teaching team will lead the classes themselves, you, the franchisee (known as a Principal in Stagecoach terms), will monitor the classes to ensure everything runs smoothly.\\nAt the end of class, the Principal will ensure all students are picked up by their parents/guardians, then check with the teachers for any debriefs needed on the school day.\\nLocations\\nLocations in the UK\\nStamford\\nRequest Free Information\\nBlackpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nTelford\\nRequest Free Information\\nStapleford\\nRequest Free Information\\nTiptree\\nRequest Free Information\\nWalgrave\\nRequest Free Information\\nTewkesbury\\nRequest Free Information\\nKing's Lynn\\nRequest Free Information\\nGreat Yarmouth\\nRequest Free Information\\nNew Forest/Lymington\\nRequest Free Information\\nNeath & Port Talbot\\nRequest Free Information\\nWorcester\\nRequest Free Information\\nWigan\\nRequest Free Information\\nSwinton\\nRequest Free Information\\nSheffield\\nRequest Free Information\\nNewquay\\nRequest Free Information\\nSittingbourne\\nRequest Free Information\\nSouthport\\nRequest Free Information\\nHartlepool\\nRequest Free Information\\nWorksop\\nRequest Free Information\\nRequest Free Information\\nRelated categories\\nChildren\\nChildrens Education\\nChilds Leisure\\nPrint\\nloading\",\n",

Owned and operated by Rental Group Ltd Registered in England No.7896244\\nSince launching in 2012, we have built a bespoke online platform that streamlines communication, bookings, and reviews, making the rental process seamless for both owners and guests. Over the years, we have developed a large network of trusted owners who rent their vehicles and holiday homes through our platform.\\nBusiness Model\\nOwners can choose from three different account types when listing their rentals on our platform:\\n- Fully Managed – We handle the entire booking process, collecting full payment from the guest and releasing funds to the owner 24 hours after check-in.\\n- Part Managed (Verification Required) – We collect an upfront service fee and provide the guest’s details to the owner, allowing them to manage the booking directly.\\n- Self Managed (Verification Required) – Owners pay a subscription fee to list on our platform and manage bookings independently, using their own payment methods.\\nHow we make money\\nOur revenue comes from multiple streams, depending on the account type chosen by rental owners:\\n- Fully Managed – We charge the customer a £20 booking fee plus commission on the booking, and we also charge the owner a commission.\\n- Part Managed – We charge the customer a £20 booking fee plus commission on the booking.\\n- Self Managed – Owners pay a yearly subscription fee to list their rentals and manage bookings independently.\\nThis flexible pricing structure ensures we provide value to both owners and guests while maintaining a profitable business model.\\nMarketing\\nOur platform is built with a highly optimised localised SEO strategy, ensuring that listings appear in relevant search results for users looking for rentals in specific locations. Over time, we have refined this approach to maximise visibility for both owners and guests, driving 100% organic traffic and increasing booking opportunities.\\nIn addition to SEO, we utilise Facebook Pixel to build a large audience of users interested in leisure holidays. This allows us to run targeted marketing campaigns on Facebook, reaching potential customers who are most likely to book through our platform.\\nDay to day running\\nThe business operates from an office-based environment with minimal manual intervention, as our system is highly automated. Daily tasks include:\\n- Listing new rental properties from owners\\n- Processing bookings and handling cancellations\\n- Managing general customer support inquiries\\nWe do not operate a phone line; all communication is handled via email and the messaging system on the owner’s dashboard, ensuring efficient and streamlined support. Our automation significantly reduces workload, making the platform easy to manage. Additionally, the business is relocatable and can be operated from anywhere in the world, offering flexibility and scalability.\\nFinancial Insights\\nFor financial insights, please contact us\\nCustomer and Market Insights\\nTraffic and User Engagement:\\nThe majority of our traffic is derived from Google’s organic, localised search results, ensuring that our platform is visible to users actively seeking rental options in specific UK locations.\\n- 2023-2024 Active Users (Site Traffic): 428k\\n- 2024-2025 Active Users (Site Traffic Traffic): 406k\\nThis still represents a solid and engaged audience base. Continued efforts in SEO and other marketing strategies can easily recover and even surpass these figures in the future.\\nScalability\\nThe business currently collaborates with most of the major UK motorhome rental companies, providing a strong foundation in the industry. Moving forward, we see significant growth potential by offering Hire & Reward insurance, which would open up opportunities for non-business owners who wish to rent out their own motorhomes.\\nThis would create a new customer segment, allowing individuals to enter the rental market without the need for a business background. By integrating this service, we could further broaden our customer base and create a seamless process for personal motorhome owners to rent out their vehicles, thereby expanding our platform's reach and increasing rental volume.\\nThe caravan and lodge category on our platform is a recent addition, and we see significant potential for growth in this area. With the right targeted marketing campaign, we believe we can attract a large number of new owners looking to list their caravans and lodges.\\nOptions to Increase business\\nWe have been approached by several insurance companies with opportunities to sell Hire & Reward insurance, Damage Deposit Excess insurance, and Breakdown Cover insurance. However, we have not yet pursued these offers, leaving a potential revenue stream untapped. Exploring these partnerships could provide additional value to our owner base while generating new income for the business.\\nMore About the Platform\\nLeisureRentalsDirect.com is powered by a database-driven platform, built on a robust framework using the latest technologies, including Laravel, Bootstrap, and Java. The platform is fully owned by us and is supported by a team of UK-based developers, with a comprehensive 24-hour, priority support package in place to ensure smooth operation.\\nWhile we handle some of the upfront development in-house, the core development of the platform is largely finalised, ensuring a stable and reliable system moving forward.\\nBusiness Transition and Support\\nWe are committed to providing comprehensive support during the transition phase to ensure a smooth handover to the new owner. This includes training, knowledge transfer, and ongoing post-sale support to ensure continuity and success.\\nAdditionally, we have a 24/7 priority support package with a team of UK-based developers.

Achieve £50,000 to £150,000 pa income with 15% ROI from property – three to four times more income than traditional buy to let portfolios – investing in quality houses of multiple occupation (HMOs).\\nFor over 15 years, we’ve used our tried and tested HMO business model to guide our Franchise Partners in the purchase, renovation and tenanting of HMOs. This low-risk model has helped more than 400 people build their successful portfolios, in a network of over 1200 high-quality properties across the country.\\nHow does it work?\\nPlatinum franchisees follow a robust and de-risked property investment model in highly profitable, but complex co-living properties. Known as Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), the Platinum model is backed by expert training, mentoring and coaching, as well as ongoing support across key areas of property investment, including planning, lettings, tax, licensing, and finance.\\nThis safety net of expertise eliminates potentially costly mistakes and protects each franchise partners’ investment capital.\\nPlatinum Property Partners helps its partners to:\\nFind suitable and development-friendly properties in high-demand areas\\nCost-effectively renovate property into multiple-room co-living properties\\nNavigate the minefield of legislation, planning and licensing that comes with letting out co-living properties\\nGrow their businesses in a tax-efficient way and scale their portfolios with ongoing support from our Power Team of business growth mentors, accountants, tax, and finance experts\\nDevelop personally and professionally and create a lasting legacy for their families\\nWhat is an HMO?\\nHouses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) might spark images of student houses or ‘low quality’, cramped properties. The co-living properties that Platinum franchise partners offer couldn’t be further from that stereotype. They are beautifully renovated, high-quality, safe, and bespoke homes for professional people.\\nThe benefits of a Platinum Property Partners franchise\\n‘I can invest in property on my own – why do I need to pay a franchise to do it?’\\nIt’s a question we hear frequently and, of course, the answer is: ‘You don’t.’\\nBut any investment is a risk and co-living / HMO property investment comes with some hugely costly potential mistakes – not least buying a property that either can’t be converted into an HMO due to licensing restraints or won’t work as a co-living home due to its layout or size.\\nOur planning, licensing, purchasing and renovation mentors don’t allow those kinds of mistakes to happen.\\nThey de-risk the process of building a property business and help to ensure our Franchise Partners generate the highest possible returns.\\nHow much does the franchise cost?\\nThe franchise fee for a 6-year partnership with Platinum is £29,995 plus VAT.\\nTo fund your property business’, you’ll need access to between £300,000 and £700,000 of working capital to cover both the franchise fee and the purchase and renovation of your first property.\\nThe actual amount of capital depends, of course, on where you are looking to invest.\\nFor example, a property in London will cost more to purchase and renovate than one in the North West or Yorkshire & The Humber.\\nWhat experience do I need?\\nThe short answer is ‘none’.\\nThe most important traits that the company looks for in potential franchisees is determination, positivity, and a community-minded outlook. If you want to become a part of the community play a part in the continued growth of what has become a powerful and collaborative network, then this is the right franchise for you.\\nPlatinum franchise partners come from all walks of life.\\nSome have property investment experience, others have none. Some have owned their own businesses before, while others are employed and remain so while they grow their businesses – until their portfolio income replaces their salary, at which time they often give up work and enjoy having more time to do the things they love.\\nBecause the community of franchise partners is built on support and collaboration, it’s important that both franchisee and franchisor are a good fit for each other.\\nSo, take that crucial first step and request more information – we’ll be in touch to find out more about you and your goals through franchising.\\nNews\\nPlanning policies and property investors – What you need to know\\n27 November 2024\\nJust days after winning the General Election, Labour announced a consultation on a revised draft of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), with hopes to take ‘decisive and early’ action.

If we assume a modest net profit margin (likely between 10-30% based on industry standards), the net profit could range from approximately £20,625 to £61,877, offering returns likely above the minimum expectations for the investor's capital. Therefore, there is potential for this business to be a viable investment.\",\n",

In short, it’s the perfect time to enter this ever-growing, evergreen market, especially under the security and reputation of an established franchise brand like Dropship Circle™.\\nWe empower aspiring e-commerce entrepreneurs to build their own successful high ticket dropshipping businesses through our exclusive mentorship and masterclass programme.\\nWHAT YOU GET FROM US\\nOur unique Partner Licence model allows you to leverage our training and ongoing support without the constraints that normally come from traditional franchises. You won’t have to endure ANY of the usual overheads – physical store, licensing fees, stock, staff, etc. – that typically raise your investment and delay profitable returns.\\nWhether you’re a novice or a seasoned entrepreneur, in just six weeks you’ll be selling high-quality, high-value products from reputable brands at £500-£10,000 in RRP. You’ll generate £300+ PER SALE, and the system is designed to require a minimum of five hours per week to fit your work-life schedule.\\nUsing local suppliers – as opposed to importing stock all the way from China – allows you to offer next-day delivery and significantly lower the environmental impact. Despite the vastness of the current e-commerce sector, high ticket dropshipping remains an untapped market opportunity – you’d be surprised how few business owners still don’t utilise this strategy.\\nA TASTE OF OUR SUCCESS\\nOur ‘Copy & Paste’ system – either the Done With You or Done For You approach – has generated profitable revenue of more than £8.25m (margins of 30%). Many of our franchise partners make £50k+ per month in net profit. You’ll have your own Shopify store created by us to fast-track your results and get you off to the best possible start.\\nOur track record has demonstrated our approach works. It’s brought us to this point where we can franchise with business operators like you.\\nWe offer franchisees our bulletproof Action Backed Refund Guarantee should you not generate profits greater than your original investment after twelve months of working with us.\\nOur 50+ 5* Star reviews on Trustpilot speak to our high levels of client satisfaction.\\nTHE MAGIC FORMULA\\nYour role in Dropship Circle™ is to focus on the growth aspects of your business:\\nIdentifying potential customers\\nProposing high-value products and solutions for their needs and challenges\\nEarning substantial upfront income and ongoing passive income with each sale\\nIt couldn’t be simpler! We handle the backend systems, which enable you to scale rapidly with minimal investment in stock or advertising.

Restaurant is in a 600 year old Grade II Listed Building with a 5 STAR HYGIENE RATING, recently renewed. Slap-Bang right in the middle of one of the busiest night time footfall Areas of SE England.\\nALCOHOL LICENCE IS TILL 12 MIDNIGHT, BUT RESTAURANT CLOSES AT 6 PM THURS-SUN. SO EVENING & NIGHT-TIME UNTAPPED POTENTIAL ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL, ESPECIALLY WITH A SEPARATE THEME EVENING BAR & EATERY.\\nThe Evening planned concept is for a Specialist Drinks, Ales & Cocktails Bar Re-Branding. A £1,000 per evening offer from a separate Pop Up Eatery, was turned down, as it was only for Saturday nights.\\nMay 2018 to May 2019 circa only approaching £400,000 Turnover, (just 7% from Alcohol), as only open 4 or 5 Days a week 10:30 am to 5:30 pm ( Closed Mon-Wens).\\n*With a best circa £28,000 Turnover in just 3 Days. April 29th to May 1st  2023.\\n** Circa nearly approaching £20,000 Turnover on just 2nd & 3rd December 2023\\nCirca 250,000 NEW HOUSES, being built, within a mere 5 or 6 minute Drive radius in the near future, plus Europe\\'s Biggest Theme Park. So absolutely unbelievable future potential! (No other Ancient sites of such Historical importance, to visit nearby.)\\n43 Daily Trains from London; journey times from 28 minutes; Fares from circa £8.50+ and Station 2 minutes Walk away. 35 minutes Drive time from Trafalgar Square, Central London is dependent upon very light traffic and time of travel.\\nBusiness was purchased as a side line to Buyer\\'s Main, (totally unrelated), Worldwide Business, as an initial Trophy site to roll out a potential new Worldwide Franchise concept, starting in maybe Spain, South Africa, East Asia or USA.\\nProof can be provided to show total invested so far circa £390,00 region, including interest, fees and extensive repairs and refurbishment Works carried out in the last 4 Years. COVID Lockdown offers of between £240,000 to nearly £290,000 was turned down for the entire business, as owner was not willing to make £80,000 loss  in 2.5 Years of business.\\nCOVID-19 1st REOPENING JULY-SEPT 2020 AVERAGE PER WEEK in the region of £10,000 to £12,000, WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SEATING AREA TO ONLY 40% and INCREASING NUMBER OF STAFF & WAGE COSTS.

Business valuation will be based on nominal Hospitality Industry average of P/E x 3, although for Trophy Location sites sale prices have been P/E x 5, or even 7.\\n10 of the 12 Mexican Restaurants in the CHILANGO chain were sold, for several Million, with just an underlying profit of  less than £800,000 at Restaurant level across all 12 Branches! Our concept is far more encompassing.\\nWe Guarantee to \"Ring Fence\", any inward investment to fund further cost-effective TROPHY LOCATION branches in UK & around the World within just 1-2 Years. Prior COVID-19 some of the future shared branch/franchise locations discussed were in Santa Barbara, La Jolla, Palm Beach, Cape Town, Durban, Malaga....and so on.\\nTherefore sensible offers invited for whole Business, but PREFERENCE will be for a much smaller \"Token\" Investment sum requirement for a salaried Management person with a proportionate shareholding in the business. As the future potential is simply enormous, but could be hindered by Management Staff inadequacies, as Owner is far too busy with their own Worldwide businesses.\\nPrice stated is for outright purchase, although only from £89,000 cash payment is based upon minimum cash deposit required for Owner Financing, subject to Status and Lien Security, to buy all the business, or preferably for a proportionate shareholding by an Investor -cum- Management person..\\nThis business would be worth triple, with good evening/ night time Profit, which should be easily achievable by an Evening concept coupled with extensive marketing and conscientious Management; especially by Investors themselves, receiving wages and a shareholding. If there is any progress in further branches and Worldwide Franchise, then value would go absolutely stratospheric!\\nUpstairs self Contained, there are 2 Rooms, both with Grade 1 listed scenic views, 2 Bathrooms plus fully fitted Kitchen. If not required, then they are sought after as 2 separate Offices at £795 pm each. Or 1 room and corridor upstairs, can be converted to VIP dining room, As Planning Approved. Premises is situated on a Private road with Residential Permit Parking only 1 minute walk away. Totally separate 3 Bed Grade 2 duplex with Grade 1 views with rental Valuation £1,750pm.\\nLong Renewable up to 25 year Restaurant Lease from £15,000+ pa excluding VAT.\\nTotal Annual Business Running Bills can all be encapsulated in 1 group set annual payment of circa £22,000+ ex pa; to include inter alia :-\\nAll Utility Services, all Telephone/Broadband Services, Business Waste Collections, Business Rates, Annual Accountant processing fees (for Weekly PAYE & NI, Quarterly VAT & annual Tax Return); Property & Business Insurances, including all equipment and maintenance contracts, (including Computerized ANTI-THEFT EPOS Cash Register & Order placing System; Fridges, Freezers, Cookers, Coffee Machine, Sound & Alarm systems, 12 Camera CCTV, AC, Ventilation systems, Electrics, Heating/ Plumbing systems, etc.)\\nTotal Winter, Spring and Autumn Annual Wages are on the low side, but Summer Wages are high indeed, The  Average Wage Bills May 2018 to May 2019 cost the business approx. around £160,000 including Employer\\'s N.I. and Pension contributions and Holiday Pay entitlements. The Annual Food, Drink and Alcohol purchases only average approx. around £50,000+ ex pa.\\nAll this means that even at this business\\'s current low Turnover, after ALL EXPENSES still nets a HIGH return on Investment. Any investment and management decision should never be based solely upon a criteria of just earning a Management salary wage and then a High return on Investment. If further UK & Overseas expansion is to be contemplated, then this would require further reinvestment, which would diminish annual cash profit initially.\\nPayment suggestions from just £89,000 would be based upon proportionate share holdings by Investors/ Management persons. Interested parties should initially carry out simple Arithmetic calculations of possible business Profitability margins, based upon the total approx. low overhead business expense figures. This is a terrific once in a Lifetime opportunity for the right Investor and Management person, or couple.\\nThe Times Newspaper of 6th January 2020, has this specific Restaurant category article on Page 43, regarding its Worldwide expansion potential.

We’ve also been consecutively placed high in the top 100 franchises in Elite Franchise, reinforcing our reputation as a top franchise choice.\\nPerhaps most impressive of all – and certainly a major factor to help attract new clients – are our established collaborations with industry giants like Disney Performing Arts, Sony and DreamWorks Animation, providing unique opportunities for our schools and students.\\nMany Stagecoach franchisees have celebrated their ten-, twenty- and twenty-five-year business anniversaries with us. One franchisee recently celebrated 30 years of operating their school, showcasing the sustainability of our model.\\nTESTIMONIALS\\n“Stagecoach has done an incredible job of building a great culture with their franchisees. They lead from the top down and I’m very proud to be part of the brand. There’s a reason they’re known as the best in the business and I hope to contribute to that reputation as I move forward with my franchise.”\\n- Kristi Wenaus, Halifax, Canada\\n“A friend who had recently acquired her Stagecoach franchise motivated and inspired me to take the leap and purchase my own. It was a significant and somewhat daunting step, but Stagecoach stood by me throughout the entire process – for which I will forever be grateful.”\\n- Natalie Wright, Stoke Newington, UK\\nWHAT PUTS STAGECOACH CENTRE STAGE?\\nOur core mission is to teach students life skills, fostering qualities like resilience, creativity, and courage that extend beyond the performing arts. All this while having fun!\\nAt Stagecoach Performing Arts, we specialise in providing an exceptional extra-curricular performing arts education for students aged 4 to 18. Our unique approach not only nurtures talent in acting, singing, and dancing but also instils what we call ‘Creative Courage for Life’.\\nOur business model not only thrives within the industry; it makes a positive impact in the communities we serve. You won’t just run a business – you will bring something beautiful, enervating, and cherished by every student who passes through your doors.\\nTHE PERFECT SCRIPT FOR SUPPORT AND TRAINING\\nIt’s understandably daunting to start a business, especially in a new field. That’s why we provide comprehensive support and training to all franchisees, including:\\nMarketing support\\nStudent recruitment assistance\\nGuidance in hiring teachers\\n24/7 access to a Child Protection Officer\\nRegional Franchise Managers are there every step of the way, acting as your tutor, mentor, partner, and confidant\\nOur in-house Education Department ensures teaching at your school is of the highest quality. You won’t be alone in this journey, as you’ll have your very own team of experts to support you.\\nAs a Stagecoach franchisee, you’ll be part of a supportive network, never left to navigate the business world alone. Our Head Office team is there to guide you every step of the way.\\nFRANCHISEE REQUIREMENTS\\nOur franchise model is designed to be accessible to individuals from diverse backgrounds.\\nWhile experience in the performing arts is not mandatory, a passion or affinity for them can be a valuable asset. Neither do you need prior experience in education or business.\\nYOUR ROLE AS A FRANCHISEE\\nA typical day in the life of a Stagecoach franchisee includes working on the various day-to-day needs of your business. For example, you might be following up on customer inquiries, planning marketing activities, chasing fees or reviewing lesson plans with teachers on an average non-school day.\\nMany Stagecoach franchisees work from home and utilise the flexibility of the business opportunity to work around their other commitments, e.g. looking after children.\\nOn days when you have classes running, you’ll need to arrive early at the venue to set up the noticeboard and check classroom spaces are safe, prepped and secure. You’ll greet your teachers and meet the parents and guardians of the students as they are dropped off for class. You will then take a register at the start of the class.\\nWhilst your teaching team will lead the classes themselves, you, the franchisee (known as a Principal in Stagecoach terms), will monitor the classes to ensure everything runs smoothly.\\nAt the end of class, the Principal will ensure all students are picked up by their parents/guardians, then check with the teachers for any debriefs needed on the school day.\\nLocations\\nLocations in the UK\\nStamford\\nRequest Free Information\\nBlackpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nTelford\\nRequest Free Information\\nStapleford\\nRequest Free Information\\nTiptree\\nRequest Free Information\\nWalgrave\\nRequest Free Information\\nTewkesbury\\nRequest Free Information\\nKing's Lynn\\nRequest Free Information\\nGreat Yarmouth\\nRequest Free Information\\nNew Forest/Lymington\\nRequest Free Information\\nNeath & Port Talbot\\nRequest Free Information\\nWorcester\\nRequest Free Information\\nWigan\\nRequest Free Information\\nSwinton\\nRequest Free Information\\nSheffield\\nRequest Free Information\\nNewquay\\nRequest Free Information\\nSittingbourne\\nRequest Free Information\\nSouthport\\nRequest Free Information\\nHartlepool\\nRequest Free Information\\nWorksop\\nRequest Free Information\\nRequest Free Information\\nRelated categories\\nChildren\\nChildrens Education\\nChilds Leisure\\nPrint\\nloading\",\n",

The lease also includes a dedicated parking space at the rear of the premises.\\nLeasehold Rent:\\n£18,000                                 per annum\\nLocation:\\nSituated in the heart of Poole, this tanning salon benefits not only from the high street's busy footfall but also from the large local residential population in Poole town. The prime location ensures consistent customer flow, with nearby businesses such as hairdressers and nail bars further enhancing its appeal.\\nPremises Details:\\nThe shop is on a 6-year lease, with just over 4 years remaining at a fixed rent. The landlord has been responsive to any issues, though there have been very few. The premises come with one parking space located at the rear, adding to its convenience. The salon itself has been recently refurbished with a modern aesthetic and features a new customer toilet.\\nBusiness Operation\\nExpansion Potential:\\nThe salon presents excellent growth opportunities. It could serve as the first of a new chain or be easily integrated into an existing franchise. There is also potential to diversify services by converting one of the tanning rooms into a beauty treatment area and expanding the range of tanning creams and retail products.\\nCompetition / Market:\\nThis salon is the only one conveniently located on the high street, making it the top choice for walk-in customers and those who frequent the surrounding shops.\\nReasons for selling:\\nThe owner is selling the business due to other commitments that require more time and attention. With other ventures demanding a higher level of involvement, it makes sense to pass the salon on to a new owner who can dedicate the necessary time to its continued growth. Additionally, the owner wants to focus on personal projects, such as renovating their home garden and then moving abroad.\\nTrading hours:\\nMon - Sat 9:30am till 7pm\\nSun 11am till 7pm\\nEmployees:\\n5\\nYears established:\\n1\\nOther Information\\nSupport & training:\\nThe current owner will provide comprehensive training to ensure a smooth transition for the new owner.

We will always be on hand to help with any questions or guidance during the handover period and beyond.\\nFurniture / Fixtures value:\\n£35,000\\n- included in the asking price\\nInventory / Stock value:\\n£1,000                            - included in the asking price\\nRelated Businesses\\nTanning Salons\\nMiscellaneous Health and Beauty Businesses\\nBeauty Salons\\nTanning Salons in Poole\\nMiscellaneous Health and Beauty Businesses in Poole\\nBeauty Salons in Poole\\nBusinesses in Poole\\nContact Seller\\nbookmark\\nSave\\nbookmark\\nSaved\\nshare\\nError\\nshare\\nShare\\nprint\\nPrint\\nShare this business\\nShare\\nPost\\nShare\\nEmail\",\n",

You don’t need care experience as you don’t do the care work yourself.\\nFranchise Information\\n9/10 people say that if they need care, they’d prefer to receive it in their own home.\\nAn alternative to care homes, Walfinch franchisees address the need to remain independent at home.\\nGrowing Need\\nYou’ll be providing a much-needed alternative. Over 430,000 people live in care homes in the UK. Life expectancy for care home residents between 2021 and 2022 was just 7 years for people aged 65-69. Life expectancy for non-care home residents in the same age group was over 23 years, so your services will reduce the quick deterioration observed in care homes (ONS).\\nNot only that, 9 out of 10 people say that if they need care, they’d prefer to receive it in their own home.\\nYou’ll have access to a growing and under-served market. The number of over 85s in the UK, the group most likely to need home care, was 1.6 million in 2018. By 2048, this is projected to rise to 3.5 million and 5.1 million by 2066 (ONS).\\nYou’ll be in demand. Requests for care were 6% higher in 2021 than in 2015/16 and requests exceeded 2 million for the first time ever in 2022-2023 (The King’s Fund).\\nYour market is far bigger than just the elderly. There were 22.2% more requests for care from the working-age population in 2022 than in 2015/16 and 900,000 additional working-age adults were living with a disability in 2021 than in 2011 (Institute for Government).\\nYou’ll have potential clients from the start. More than half a million people were waiting for adult social care in May 2022 and the proportion of those waiting more than 6 months reached 36.5% in March 2023 which is up from 20.2% in November 2021 (Home Care Association/Institute for Government).\\nYou’ll be in demand all year round so you’ll experience continuous growth, and you’ll have multiple sources of income because you’ll be offering a range of specialist services to lots of different age groups including hourly visiting care and 24/7 live-in care.\\nRegulator Registration Made Easy\\nExperience in care is not necessary if you want to buy a home care franchise. Most franchisees didn’t work in the care sector before joining Walfinch.\\nTracy Lezar, Managing Director of Walfinch Kingston and Weybridge, is South African and worked in various sales and marketing roles before joining Walfinch.\\nTracy and her aunt, Kathleen Plough, were looking at businesses opportunities together when they stumbled across Walfinch.\\nThey very quickly decided to move to the UK to set their franchise up.\\nHowever, with no experience of care and regulations in the UK, Tracy didn’t know where to start when it came to getting her home care business registered with CQC.\\nThis is where Walfinch come in. When you join, you’ll be supported by an experienced Quality and Compliance Manager whose job is to get you registered with your regulator as quickly as possible so you can start trading and focusing on growing your business.\\nTracy is now in the top 5 earners at Walfinch and holds the most live-in care packages in the network.\\nWhat training and support does Walfinch provide franchisees?\\nEven though Sarah has been working in care for a while, most Walfinch franchisees do not come from a care background. This is why your training is extensive and ongoing:\\nInitial Training:\\n5 day face to face programme for 2 directors, followed by 5 days online.\\nSupport registering your business with your regulator\\nHelp recruiting your first Registered Manager\\n8-week compliance training programme, with weekly 1 hour sessions\\nHelp finding your first office\\nBusiness plan and launch strategy\\nSupport setting pay and charge rates\\nOngoing Training:\\nAnnual support calendar including 10-12 online workshops, 3 face to face regional meetings for you, 3 for your Registered Manager, and an annual conference\\nSupport during regulator site visits\\nAssistance buying additional territories\\nGuidance on recruiting the right people\\nRegularly reviewing KPIs to help you hit your targets\\nWeekly marketing surgery\\nAssistance selling your business when you’re ready\\nBecome a multi-unit franchisee\\nOur goals is for you to own more than 1 territory so you can meet your professional, personal, and financial goals.\\nSarah Wickham was one of our first franchisees.\\nSarah completed her NVQ Level 4 in the late 80s because she wanted to become a Registered Manager and she spent 25 years working in this role for some large care companies.\\nSarah is a keen rugby fan and was the President of Southwold Rugby Club between 2017 and 2020.\\nBusiness development is everything at Walfinch and our aim is to help you become a multi-unit franchisee over time.

We will provide a business plan template and this will allow you to adjust key figures to ensure that it is ideally suited to your territory.\\nAre there any other costs I can expect?\\nYes, other costs to budget for include a local office, local advertising, computer, office rent and working capital. Working capital will depend on how much money you need to draw from the business during the set-up of the business.\\nWhat is my expected break-even and how long should it take me to reach it?\\nThe time to reach break-even is governed by how long it takes to find carers and clients for your business but our experience is that it normally takes anything from 12-18 months to achieve profitability.\\nDo I need any healthcare training or background to join Walfinch?\\nNo, but a background in business and an understanding of how a business operates is desirable.\\nWill you help me find clients?\\nYes, we train you to find your first 100 local contacts in your territory and provide training on the business development system.

However, without specific net profit figures, it's challenging to precisely evaluate ROI. Given the high turnover potential and support provided to franchisees, this business might be worth considering for more detailed analysis. Generally, profitability would need to be clearly ascertained to ensure it meets expectations for an investment of this size.\",\n",
