You can expect to enjoy a huge slice of that (yeah, we went there) by joining the Fat Pizza franchise. We’re on course to become the UK’s 4th biggest pizza chain by 2025, with 50-75 stores planned by the end of 2024 alone.\\nWith high demand averaging £18k in weekly sales, the Fat Pizza franchise has a proven business model that demonstrates our profitability for franchisees. Our low opening costs make this a readily accessible opportunity for entrepreneurs, and your profits will start rolling in that much sooner.\\nWHAT DO WE DELIVER?\\nOur aim is to gain Customers For Life, rather than rely on people now and then coming to us through the odd discount. We do this by making sure all parties get the very best from Fat Pizza:\\nTo our customers, we deliver top-quality, fresh pizzas made straight from flour using our unique secret dough recipe, and we offer a simple pricing structure that’s readily adaptable to market changes.\\nTo our franchisees, our recognized brand gets you off the start line and ahead of the competition before you even put your first pizza in the oven. With our centralized call handling and cutting-edge tech that enhances the customer experience through automated ordering, delivery tracking and A.I.-based targeted segmented marketing, you can focus on core operations, streamlining your workflow and maximizing efficiency.\\nWe also appreciate the importance of digital marketing – no cheap junk mail leaflets – utilizing in-house expertise to engage with customers through social media and online platforms. Perhaps best of all, franchisees gain instant access to our founder, who welcomes direct communication from potential franchisees to answer your questions and share his wealth of experience and industry knowledge. Don’t be shy; contact us to discuss your ambitions and aspirations.\\nACHIEVEMENTS\\nPAPA Gold Award, British Takeaway Awards\\nA growing franchise that has a centralized management and marketing model, so you’re free to run core operations\\nThe Fat Pizza founder is Vice-Chairman of the PAPA Management Committee, helping to formulate industry-level opinions and practices\\nWe’ve developed a system that can reply to each customer in real-time with every delivery\\nOur call center now handles all calls, orders, and inquiries, so you and your franchise partners can all apply yourselves to the most critical part of the operation: making and delivering pizza, burgers, and desserts!\\nFLEXIBILITY TO YOUR NEEDS\\nOur pragmatic approach to helping franchisees run their stores and customers getting their food delivered hot and fresh to their doors means we run takeaway-delivery franchises. What has helped us grow even further in the field and at great speed is that if you currently run an existing food business, it can be converted into a Fat Pizza outlet, or you can attach Fat Pizza to locations like restaurants, pubs, etc. The only geographical restriction is that we don’t allow any Fat Pizza store to open within a three-mile radius of our other outlets.\\nSUPPORT & TRAINING\\nOur menu is extensive yet simple to make, meaning you don’t need to be a qualified chef. Within four hours of training in one of our stores, you’ll be able to make everything yourself from scratch! We also run pioneering support videos demonstrating how to make every item on the menu. After just an hour of working with one of our tablets, you can run an entire store shift.\\nTraining lasts up to a week in one of our stores. After that, you will have ongoing support from us through our centralized call center, responding to all messages, reviews and comments on your behalf. It means we usually know about any issues before you do. This means we can solve problems before they impact you and your sales!\\nFRANCHISEE TESTIMONIALS\\n“Sunny has helped us open our store from store location to opening personally. The organized marketing is all digital, and the App is our best source of income. We do not have to do anything but deliver pizza, which our customers say is the best around.”\\n“No phones ring in my shop, this is what I love most about Fat Pizza. We have the best pizza around, and my friends are looking at buying more stores around my area.”\\nA DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FRANCHISEE\\nOpening up your store includes following the electronic opening procedure to ensure all food safety standards are met. Pizza dough is made up and left to proof in pans before prepping for the day’s shift. All orders come through with a beep on the makeline so you won’t have the endless noise of phones ringing all day. Orders are made and dispatched to our own fleet of drivers using an app, so we always know where the driver is to help monitor and improve delivery journeys.\\nIt’s a simple, effective and efficient operation that has been proven to work through our growing success. Now, we can offer you the chance to join our growing Fat Pizza network today. So get in touch and see what your future could hold with us!\\nHOW MUCH IS A FRANCHISE?\\nIn terms of finance, the costs to open a Fat Pizza franchise vary from £12k (to convert an existing takeaway with no need for new equipment) to around £80k maximum for a brand-new unit from scratch. The central factor of running a Fat Pizza store is staff management. You will typically work with shift managers to set the week’s rota, use the POS system to work out delivery times from previous weeks and “review the reviews!” It’s all about running a smooth operation while building on experience.\\nLocations\\nLocations in the UK\\nOxford\\nRequest Free Information\\nWarwick\\nRequest Free Information\\nLeicester\\nRequest Free Information\\nBerkshire\\nRequest Free Information\\nHertfordshire\\nRequest Free Information\\nCambridge\\nRequest Free Information\\nSurrey\\nRequest Free Information\\nLiverpool\\nRequest Free Information\\nKent\\nRequest Free Information\\nEssex\\nRequest Free Information\\nRequest Free Information\\nRelated categories\\nFood\\nFast Food\\nPizza\\nTop Franchises\\nPrint\\nloading', 'cleaned_content': 'The Fat Pizza - Pizza Takeaway Franchise available in Warwick\\n\\nFranchise Fee:\\n£12,000\\n\\nLiquid Capital:\\n£30,000\\n\\nLocation:\\nWarwick\\n\\nThe pizza home delivery market is currently worth £3.7 billion.
